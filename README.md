# Overview

This repo contains code from the "TensorFlow for poets 2" series of codelabs. With some modification for classification of Dogs

There are multiple versions of this codelab depending on which version 
of the tensorflow libraries you plan on using:



This repo contains simplified and trimmed down version of tensorflow's example image classification of Dogs


The `scripts` directory contains helpers for the training the model. Some of these come from the main TensorFlow repository, and are included here so you can use them without also downloading the main TensorFlow repo (they are not part of the TensorFlow `pip` installation).
